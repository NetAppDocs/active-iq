The Config Drift feature identifies configuration deviations by comparing a system template to a “golden” or base system template. You can schedule weekly or monthly drift reports or generate them on-demand. You can mitigate some deviations by using the Ansible Playbooks, which are provided in the config drift report.

This feature is available to systems with Advisor and Expert Support contracts only.

You can look at the following diagram to understand the workflow to identify configuration deviations and generate the report.
