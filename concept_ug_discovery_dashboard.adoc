The *Active IQ Discovery Dashboard* serves as an efficient method for watching systems important to our users and quickly recognizing critical events and technical issues, and taking actions.

Discovery dashboard can be accessed from top menu of Active IQ home page and is only available to Partners and NetApp internal users. More details about the *Discovery Dashboard* can be found in a separate user guide from the dashboard page to authorized users.
