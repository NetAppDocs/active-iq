As you start using Digital Advisor, it is important that you understand some of the basic terms that you can expect to see throughout the Digital Advisor.

* *Watchlist:* Provides you the flexibility to access systems inside Digital Advisor that have already been selected. You can use watchlists to add systems from either one or more customers.
** *Wellness Dashboard:* Provides an overall status of the systems in the watchlist.
** *Widgets:* Displays small applications on the Dashboard that provide you a quick summary of the status of the systems.
** *Risks:* Displays a list of systems with their respective issues. It has different severity levels:
*** High risks
*** Medium risks
*** No risks
** *Unique Risks:* Displays the risk names and number of systems for a specific risk category.
** *Actions:* Displays the number of unique actions that you can take to fix the issues.
** *Color-coded risk status*: Displays risk levels and their color codes that are classified into 3 levels on the basis of their severity levels. The use of colors allows a faster assessment of the levels of risk involved.

** *Performance & Efficiency:* Displays information about the performance and efficiency of the storage system.
** *Availability & Protection:* Displays information about the availability and protection of the storage system.
** *Capacity:* Consists of risks with a capacity attribute for impact area values.
** *Configuration:* Consists of risks with a configuration attribute for impact area values sorted with the highest impact on the top.
** *Security vulnerabilities:* Consists of risks with a security attribute for impact area values.
** *Wellness History:* Displays information about system risks occurring in the past three months, so that you can learn how they are faring overtime.
** *Ransomware Defense:* Provides information about risks and corrective actions associated with ransomware detection, prevention, and recovery.
