You can subscribe to the wellness review email to receive monthly email notifications that summarize wellness status of systemsâ€”that are nearing their renewal dates and require an upgrade for the NetApp products in your installed base.
You will receive wellness review email, so that you can view a monthly summary of your systems and take actions for them.


After the subscription is enabled, the email is sent out on the first Monday of each month. The email summary provides a view of outstanding wellness, renewal, upgrade, and health check actions. You can confirm the email address and the email is sent to the specified email address.
You also have options to view, edit, share, and delete your subscriptions. At any time, if you decide to not receive email, you can unsubscribe from receiving email notifications.
*Note*: This feature is available only through NetApp SupportEdge Advisor and SupportEdge Expert service offerings.
