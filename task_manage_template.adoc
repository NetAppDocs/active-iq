You can clone a template, share a template, edit the details of an existing template, and delete a template.

Sharing a template saves the time and effort required to create and customize a template that has already been created by a user. Shared templates can be mutually changed by shared users, allowing several users to make modifications to a single golden template.

*About this task*

* Access to shared templates can be revoked at any time.
* Shared users can delete this template from their account at any time.

.Steps
. From the left pane, click *Config Drift*.
. Click image:clone_icon.png[clone] to make a copy of the template.
. Click image:share_icon.png[share] and enter the usernames with whom you want to share the template.
+
NOTE: If you enter the email address of the user instead of the username, the template will not be shared.

. Click image:edit_icon.png[edit] to update the details of the template.
. Click image:delete_icon.png[delete] to delete the template.
