Experienced users can follow the steps below to install and execute the AFF and FAS firmware ansible automation package quickly.

== Firmware update with Ansible using NetApp Docker Image

.Steps
. Pull the Ansible Docker image to the Linux host:
+
----
$ docker pull schmots1/netapp-ansible
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from schmots1/netapp-ansible
docker.io/schmots1/netapp-ansible:latest
----
. Run the docker image as container on the Linux host:
+
----
$ docker run -v <downloaded_playbook_path>:/<container_path> -it schmots1/netapp-ansible:latest /bin/bash
----
NOTE: The Ansible Playbook and the inventory file should be in the same path.

. Execute the Ansible Playbook on the Linux host. Firmware updates run in the background for a few hours.
+
----
$ cd <container_path>
$ ansible-playbook na_ontap_pb_upgrade_firmware.yml

Enter your ONTAP admin username: ****
Enter the password for your ONTAP admin user: ****
Enter the base URL to the firmware package (using HTTP is recommended):â€¯http://<web-server>/path/
PLAY [ONTAP Firmware Upgrade] ****************************************************************
----
NOTE: If the URLs for disk firmware, shelf firmware, and service processor firmware are *\http://<web-server>/path/all_shelf_fw.zip*, *\http://<web-server>/path/all.zip* and  *\http://<web-server>/path/<SP/BMC>_<version_number>_fw.zip*, provide *\http://<web-server>/path/* as the input for the base URL to the firmware package. If there are set of clusters with different login credentials, the Ansible Playbook must be run on each cluster. There are no changes required to the inventory file as the Ansible Playbook skips the clusters for which the login has failed.

. Log in to the cluster as the cluster administrator and verify that the new drive firmware has been installed:
+
----
::> storage disk show -fields firmware-revision,model
 disk     firmware-revision model
--------------- ----------------- ----------------
1.11.0   NA01              X423_HCOBE900A10
