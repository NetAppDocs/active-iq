From the *Cluster* and node dashboards, and *AutoSupport*, you will now see a link to view configuration details, called Cluster Viewer. Cluster Viewer enables you to see detailed physical and logical configuration details. The details are presented in several easy-to-view tables across multiple tabs that include a summary of the configuration, stack diagram, the network interfaces, a summary of SVMs & aggregates, volume and LUN information, and a few visualizations. Visualization is the graphical view available of how the system is cabled showing connectivity between controllers and shelves. The details available from *Cluster Viewer* are downloadable in DOC, XLS, and PDF. Note that the graphical view download is currently separate from the download of all the tables.

=== Sample Cable Visualization

You can view the cable visualization to see details of how the cluster is cabled. You can zoom in or out; there are also options to select parts of the visualization. Additionally, you can export the visualization in SVG, which can then be edited in Visio.
