This following are the new features that provide you a simple way to view efficiency ratios for All Flash FAS (AFF) systems. Ratios consider the following efficiency features included in ONTAP:

* In-line data compaction (applies to ONTAP 9 and later)
* In-line aggregate deduplication (applies to ONTAP 9.2 and later)
* In-line volume deduplication
* In-line compression
* Volume snapshots and clones
* LUN and file clones
* Background deduplication
** Background volume deduplication
** Background aggregate deduplication (Automatically enabled via automatic deduplication schedule starting ONTAP 9.3)

More details about ratios are in <<concept_aiq_AFF_SE_appendix.html#Appendix,Appendix>> at the end of this document.
