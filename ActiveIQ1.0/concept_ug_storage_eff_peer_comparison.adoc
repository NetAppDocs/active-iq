Drawing on diagnostic records from more than 300K devices across NetAppâ€™s user base, Active IQ is constantly learning, giving you insights to unleash the full potential of your data. Storage Efficiency Advisor uses Community Wisdom of AutoSupport data from all NetApp customers and compares the efficiency number of your system against the latest All-Flash models from NetApp where all the best practices are followed.

This feature, available for all Active IQ users, is enabled at a single system level for FAS systems above ONTAP 9.1 and AFF systems above ONTAP 8.3.2. For AFF systems, it also shows the best practice gaps and suggests ways of getting improved efficiency ratios. Also, provides low touch option for customers who wish to upgrade to latest AFF models.
