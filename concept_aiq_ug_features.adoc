=== Watchlists

Watchlists enable you to access preselected systems inside Active IQ quickly and easily.

Watchlists are accessible from top menu and allow you to group systems within or across customers.

image:image3.png[image,width=602,height=244]

With this functionality, you can group up to 5,000 systems in a single watchlist. Enter a list name and the serial numbers of the systems you would like to include in the Watchlists dialog box and click Submit. Lists allow inclusion of systems you are entitled to access. After the Watchlist is saved, click list name link for details.

*NEW*: Watchlists also allows you to add systems from one or more customers. When this is done, there is no need to update the list of systems belonging to these customers when systems get added or removed from customers’ installed base. This is a significant productivity savings over adding systems using serial #s. You can add as many customers as you need to as long as the total number of systems is within 5,000.

See *Reports* feature to learn more about reports you can generate using systems in a Watchlist.

=== Manual AutoSupport Upload

This functionality allows you to submit AutoSupport messages from ONTAP and E-Series systems that lack Internet access or the capability to regularly send these messages. Manual AutoSupport upload functionality gives you the same benefits as traditional AutoSupport enablement, including improved storage system visibility and access to detailed reports about risks, storage efficiency, and upgrade planning. To submit a manual AutoSupport upload of messages, click the AutoSupport Upload button in the top banner, select the files, and click Upload. Refer to frequently asked questions within the widget for answers to questions about browser support, how to collect AutoSupport messages from storage systems for upload, supported formats, and more.

=== NEW: Config Compare (BETA) with Popular Configuration Templates

The new Config Compare feature allows you to detect configuration deviations in near real time. It allows you to create a template using a default we provide or selecting one from one of the systems in your installed base. Once a template is created, you can subscribe to create a subscription to get change notifications in near real time via email or on the “Deviation Result” tab of the feature. This feature is still in Beta, we support limited sections for comparison within the template.

You can use Popular Configuration powered by Active IQ Community Wisdom, Default Configuration or System AutoSupport templates to see differences or anomalies in configurations. Instant Compare of Configurations is coming soon.

Seeing comparisons and drifts involve three steps:

==== Capacity Forecasting for ONTAP systems

This widget on the customer dashboard gives you a 1, 3, and 6 months’ view of systems that may have already breached the preset 90% capacity threshold or may be about to breach it within these time-periods.

Clicking the icon you can download details about all impacted systems. In the example capacity forecast below for a customer:

* Three systems are already over 90% capacity
* There are no systems that will be over 90% capacity in 1 to 6-month timeframe
* There are 171 systems that will be under 90% capacity in 6 months
+
*NOTE*: Capacity forecasts are computed based on past usage and growth patterns. If there are materially significant changes in usage or growth, these predictions may not hold, and more systems may be over 90% capacity sooner.

image:image16.png[image,width=390,height=242]

To ensure that systems do not run out of space, you can request for storage from the Capacity Widget by selecting the systems and clicking the mail icon. You can select multiple systems at once to request capacity.

image:image17.png[image,width=496,height=138]

Total capacity displayed is the sum of all the aggregate’s total capacity and used capacity is the sum of all the aggregate’s physical used space.

==== Support Contract Renewals Widget

This widget on customer dashboard gives you the list of support contracts expiring. User can request renewals of support contract by clicking on mail icon.

It displays:

* Support Contract already expired
* Support Contract expiring within 6 months

Storage dashboard shows the storage efficiency ratio, capacity and savings for entire storage systems running ONTAP 9.1 and above. Efficiency ratio and savings can be seen with and without Snapshots and for only AFF, only non-AFF systems or both.

Total savings across customer storage can be seen per efficiency feature such as snapshots, clones, deduplication, compression and compaction.

image:image23.png[image,width=623,height=393]

=== Active IQ Advisories

==== Flash Advisor

Flash Advisor recommends a list of volumes that contain workloads that will perform better if moved to AFF systems. Users can select volumes and submit a request to upgrade the system to flash.

We determine the list of volumes by looking at characteristic’s other users across the installed base have benefited from. A list of these characteristics is available from the information icon on the top right of this widget.

image:image24.png[image,width=498,height=272]

===== Criteria for determining Flash candidates

image:image25.png[image,width=448,height=240]

==== Protection Advisor

image:image26.png[image,width=480,height=249]

==== Performance Guarantee Best Practice Gaps

Performance Guarantee Promotion offers Latency guarantee with select AFF A-series systems. NetApp guarantees 99% of the latency measured hourly over 100-hour period is below 1ms/500μs with select AFF A-series systems.

Performance Guarantee Best Practice Gaps widget helps to identify the systems and volumes that are not following the following best practices that are defined for Performance Guarantee Promotion.

* All volumes are managed by Adaptive QoS in the NetApp Service Level Manager with PS engagement
* Current ONTAP GA release
* Each volume size is less than 10% of the usable storage of the node.
* No aggregate is over 80% full
* More than 100 average IOPS per volume per hour
* Random read should be greater than 30 %
* Average IO block size is equal to 32k or below on all volumes on a node.
* The host application may not request more IOPS than the greater of 1k IOPs or the IOPS per gigabyte
* Replication or backup schedule greater than or equal to 4 hours
* Snapshot schedule greater than or equal to one hour.

image:image27.png[image,width=481,height=158]

=== System Dashboard

The System Fitness Dashboard offers more detailed information and it includes detail about the following:

* Configuration
* Capacity Forecasting
* Performance Chart
* Storage Efficiency Ratio
* System Risks and Alerts
* ONTAP Upgrade Recommendations
* AutoSupport On Demand enablement

The left side of the dashboard provides access to additional detailed information for above listed items and more, some of which are described later in this document.

=== NEW - Storage Efficiency Peer Comparison

Drawing on diagnostic records from more than 300K devices across NetApp’s user base, Active IQ is constantly learning, giving you insights to unleash the full potential of your data. Storage Efficiency Advisor uses community wisdom of AutoSupport data from all NetApp customers and compares the efficiency number of your system against the latest All-Flash models from NetApp where all best practices are followed.

This feature, available for all Active IQ users, is enabled at a single system level for FAS systems above ONTAP 9.1 and AFF systems above ONTAP 8.3.2. For AFF systems, it also shows the best practice gaps and suggests ways of getting improved efficiency ratios. Also, provides low touch option for customers who wish to upgrade to latest AFF models.

image:image28.png[image,width=326,height=177]

=== Workload Tagging

This feature allows users to tag volumes within Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) in ONTAP systems (cDOT only) with workload details. One or more volumes can be tagged to a specific workload using selecting a workload from the pre-defined dropdown list.

Once volumes are tagged, NetApp will make recommendations and best practices available that will help users to improve performance, efficiency, and availability of NetApp systems.

The feature is accessible by clicking the image:image29.png[image,width=21,height=18] icon from left navigation of ONTAP cluster.

In the Cluster dashboard, summary of total number volumes that are not tagged are shown. image:image30.png[image,width=106,height=49]

You can tag volumes with the Workload, Application, Protocol and Container. Workload is an enterprise workload and Application is defined as a User Application/Products.

image:image31.png[image,width=259,height=229]

There are three different type of workload tags:

* *ONTAP tag* is the tag obtained from ONTAP AutoSupport when workload template in System Manager is used to provision.
* *Auto Generated Tag* is the tag that is tagged by auto detection mechanisms using machine learning. Active IQ can intelligently identify the type of workload running on the volume. Unidentified volumes are tagged as Other.
* *User Tag* is the tag provided by user manually using tagging feature in workload tagging in Active IQ. Only user tags can be modified or untagged.

Workload Tagging UI is built with rich features including advanced filters. Workload Tag table can be filtered using SVM, Volume Name, Tagged Workloads, Application, Protocol and Container. It helps identifying volumes, workloads and choose multiple volumes to tag at once. You can search for a volume by using a pattern that can match between the volume names. You can also download the entire workload tag list.

image:image32.png[image,width=624,height=278]

==== Workload and Application Efficiency and Capacity

Once the volumes are tagged, Active IQ provides Total Capacity and Efficiency for each workload and application. It also provides volumes level efficiency and capacity. You can filter the workloads in efficiency dashboard based on tag type.

All the efficiency ratios provided are excluding Snapshots and clones.

==== Comparison with Peer Ratio powered by Community Wisdom

Calculated Workload Efficiency Ratio is compared with Peer / Guaranteed Ratio of each workload defined. Peer Ratio is calculated based on average efficiency ratio of the workloads identified using Active IQ community wisdom. Peer Ratio is defined based for each ONTAP version and compared with the respective ONTAP version running on the cluster.

image:image33.png[image,width=597,height=327]

Additional features are planned using workload tagging such as showing best practices, performance trends and also tighter integration with other NetApp Products.

=== Performance

From the System Fitness Dashboard, you can click the Performance icon (image:image34.png[image,width=30,height=30] ) to view the performance history of your system. These charts provide up to 60 days of historical performance data, which is useful for performance trend and pattern analysis. The hourly averages used to prepare these charts are reported in a daily performance AutoSupport data summary.

System interruptions, such as reboots and service disablements, can cause gaps in the chart. These performance charts are intended for trending analysis, and NetApp does not recommend them for detailed performance monitoring or diagnostics; you should use onsite products such as OnCommand products for such use cases.

There are several viewable performance charts including Peak Performance (Headroom), CPU and Disk Utilization, IOPS, Latency and Throughput. Users can check one or more of these charts for selective viewing of performance charts. Charts are downloadable in PDF, SVG, and PNG formats. You can also export all the counter information into a CSV from the menu.

*Peak performance zone* is the area, which is equal to or below the peak performance line. In simple terms, it specifies the limit of good operating behavior for the given storage resource. When a resource's utilization rises above this line, the client latencies increases rapidly.

*Headroom is the difference between peak performance line and current utilization line*. Monitor the performance graphs periodically to identify the nodes that may run out of headroom. If the current resources utilization is above this peak performance line for an extended time, a performance remediation plan might be appropriate. A performance remediation plan might include setting QoS workload limits, moving volumes or LUNs to another storage controller, or expanding the storage cluster.

The confidence factor is used to determine the accuracy of the peak performance line that is used in CPU and aggregate headroom graphs. The confidence factor counter indicates how good the range of utilizations and latencies were observed for a resource in the system. The higher the confidence factor, the more accurate the peak performance line will be. Confidence factors range from 1 (low) to 3 (high).

There are cluster aggregated performance charts in cluster performance dashboard and can view node level graphs.

*Note*: Response Time by Protocol and Concurrency graphs are not available for cDOT systems.

The following is the performance chart at the cluster level:

image:image35.png[image,width=557,height=248]

The following is the performance chart at the system level:

image:image36.png[image,width=505,height=262]

=== Health

The Health tab (image:image37.png[image,width=29,height=30]) contains system risks that identifies configuration or other kinds of issues that may impair system performance, availability, and resiliency. Each risk entry contains information about the specific risk, the potential negative impact, and links to mitigation plans for that risk. Addressing these risks proactively can improve your NetApp storage availability.

Impact Level Definitions:

* *High* – High potential of a system outage or data corruption, address immediately. Examples include HA Takeover Impossible and Shutdown Pending.
* *Medium* – May cause system downtime such as a panic. Address as soon as possible.
* *Low* – Minimal impact but should be addressed for increased system stability. Examples include bypass disks present, SnapMirror sync failure, and RSDT not working.
* *Best Practice* – Recommendation defined by a Technical Report (TR) or Knowledge Base (KB) article.

Case Probability analyzes risk data and technical support case data from the last two to three years. Using machine learning determines the likelihood that a technical support case will be opened for the system within 90 days of the risk being detected. This results in determining strong correlation between the first discovery of a risk and whether a case is opened.

Using the risk’s impact level and the risk to case confidence value to compute a “Case Probability” score. This score is used to rank the risks present on a system for which risk should be mitigated first.

image:image38.png[image,width=624,height=206]

==== Security Vulnerability

The Security Vulnerability tab identifies systems with security risks. This tab contains information about the specific risk, the potential negative impact and link to the CVE bulletin.

Impact Level Definitions for Security Risks

The Impact level for Security Risks is based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and noted in the Impact section of the CVE bulletin. The CVSS provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities. Its quantitative model ensures repeatable accurate measurement while enabling users to see the underlying vulnerability characteristics that were used to generate the scores. Thus, CVSS is well suited as a standard measurement system for industries, organizations, and governments that need accurate and consistent vulnerability impact scores. For more information, please visit https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss

image:image39.png[image,width=624,height=231]

*TIP*: If you would like to receive system risk report on a regular basis, click on “*Schedule a Risk Report”.*

==== Best Practices

Best practices are available from the Health Summary tab in the left navigation pane and the Fitness quadrant of the Fitness Dashboard. Gaps in best practices are highlighted, and corrective actions are listed for mitigation. Best practices are available at both the system and aggregate levels (customer, site, and group), helping you to standardize your storage environment and enhance its operational efficiency.

image:image40.png[image,width=624,height=230]

*TIP*: Review Best Practices for checking whether you have implemented Storage Efficiency Best Practices according to NetApp recommendations.

==== Health Trending

It is extremely important to mitigate risks in a timely manner to prevent critical issues. The Health Trending feature provides up to a 3-month view of System Risks, Best Practices, and End of Support so that as you mitigate these conditions, you can track the progress with weekly reports. These reports show you a summary of trends and allow you to drill down and analyze individual risks. Trending is available at both single system and customer level. You can download these reports in a PDF format.

image:image41.png[image,width=624,height=249]

==== System Risk Acknowledgement

Use the System Risk Acknowledgement feature to gain the greatest flexibility in managing how risks detected across your systems are displayed in your dashboard. This feature enables you to customize your risk dashboard so that it displays only the risks you deem to be most critical to your environment.

Acknowledging a risk is a way of flagging it in your dashboard. Setting your preferences to “Hide Acknowledged Risks” removes the flagged risks from your active default Health Summary view. All acknowledged risks are still viewable from the “Acknowledged System Health” tab.

*Best Practice:* Complete the “justification” field when you acknowledge a risk to document the rationale behind the acknowledgement.

*Note:* If you are a NetApp Internal user acknowledging on behalf of a customer with their approval, please add the customer’s name in the “Approved By” field for future reference and trackability.

image:image42.png[image,width=498,height=232]

==== Risk Advisor

By using Risk Advisor, users can see how many risks can be mitigated just by doing an ONTAP upgrade. Only systems that can be upgraded to ONTAP 9.x will be shown.

==== Community Wisdom

Based on other systems with the same risk that upgraded, community wisdom gives the likelihood of the risk being mitigated by upgrading ONTAP along with a level of confidence. This is presented in the last two columns as “Risk present after upgrade” and “% of Risk resolved after ONTAP upgrade” column.

==== Benefits

* Better system availability by lowering risk profile
* Reduces planning time for upgrades – you know which systems will benefit from upgrade from a single report
* Additional benefit of newer features in ONTAP 9
* Your risk mitigation improves the confidence level of our recommendations

image:image43.png[image,width=614,height=188]

=== Interop Advisor

Interop Advisor allows you to check the compatibility of hosts by using data collected by NetApp OneCollect tool. It provides support information by automatically checking with Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) and giving upgrade recommendations for host operating systems, drivers and firmware.

=== AutoSupport Viewer

With the AutoSupport Viewer you can view full AutoSupport details, including weekly AutoSupport logs. The left panel contains a menu that lists all the subsections of an AutoSupport message. The most commonly used AutoSupport sections appear at the top, and the rest of the sections are listed in alphabetical order. This is a good place to selectively view individual AutoSupport sections without going through the entire AutoSupport message.

By default, wherever available, the sysconfig –a section of the latest weekly AutoSupport message, is displayed.

You can also download the complete AutoSupport message in either HTML or text format for viewing or troubleshooting.

Newly added functionalities also allow the following:

* Filtering of AutoSupports by type of AutoSupport (Management, Performance, Weekly, Other)
* Searching by section name
* Simple tabular viewing of XML sections – you can change column positions, save column preferences, and download the XML section in an Excel file for further use and analysis.

image:image49.png[image,width=570,height=306]

=== Cluster Viewer (ONTAP Only)

From the Cluster and node dashboards and the AutoSupport viewer, you will now see a link to view configuration details, called Cluster Viewer. Cluster Viewer allows you to see detailed physical and logical configuration details. The details are presented in several easy to view tables across multiple tabs that include a summary of the configuration, stack diagram, network interfaces, summary of SVMs & aggregates, volume and LUN information, and a few visualizations. Visualization is the graphical view available of how the system is cabled showing connectivity between controllers and shelves. The details available from Cluster Viewer are downloadable in DOC, XLS, and PDF. Note that the graphical view download is currently separate from the download of all the tables.

image:image50.png[image,width=623,height=36]

=== Types of visualizations

image:image51.png[image,width=165,height=153]

==== Sample Cable Visualization

You can view the cable visualization to see details of how the cluster is cabled. You can zoom in or out, and also options to select parts of the visualization. Additionally, you can export the visualization in SVG, which can then be edited in Visio.

image:image52.png[image,width=623,height=188]

==== AutoSupport Alerts

AutoSupport alerts, available from the left navigation pane, are notifications sent to you about issues that may affect the health, availability, or uptime of your storage systems. AutoSupport detects known issues and sends you a notification about them so that you can take mitigation measures. These alerts are available in addition to the e-mail notifications sent out to you. You can also see a history of these alerts for the last 90 days.

You can view AutoSupport alerts at the single-system and aggregate levels. You can also turn off e-mail notifications for these events and apply the preferences at a system or a site level.

The AutoSupport Alerts interface includes AutoSupport header details complete with the contact information of the people receiving notifications.

*Best practice*: Use a group distribution list or group e-mail address so that, if individuals are away, others can still receive critical AutoSupport notifications by e-mail.

==== Upgrade Advisor

Upgrade Advisor offers a quick, automated, and accurate way to generate a Data ONTAP upgrade plan. From the System or Customer Dashboard, click the image:image55.png[image,width=27,height=27] icon to open a screen to what is shown in the figure below. By default, if you are clicking this from a system level, all nodes of the cluster or the HA-Pair (for 7-Mode systems) are auto populated.

image:image56.png[image,width=624,height=266]

In the next step, the recommended version of ONTAP is suggested. In some cases, users may prefer to stay at a higher or a lower version of ONTAP based on the needs of their installed base and standards.

image:image57.png[image,width=623,height=244]

=== Cluster Dashboard

The new cluster dashboard is the central place to look for information about ONTAP clusters. The dashboard also consolidates health, capacity, storage efficiency and performance insights.

There are two main ways to reach the cluster dashboard:

[arabic]
. By searching a cluster name
. By searching for a node within the cluster – by default you land on the cluster dashboard the node belongs to. From there you have shortcuts to reach the individual nodes.

The figure below shows the functionalities and information available from the cluster dashboard.

image:image58.png[image,width=623,height=564]

Cluster Dashboard has the following components:

At the top of the dashboard, the following critical information about the cluster is summarized:

* High Impact Risks
* Upgrade Recommendations
* AutoSupport On Demand Status
* End of Support details

The cluster dashboard also has more detailed information in the following widgets:

*Configuration* – This widget lists all the nodes in the cluster and also provides hostname, serial number, system ID, ONTAP version, and model of the nodes within the cluster. From the “View Configuration Details” button on top of this widget, you are able to see additional details about the cluster through the new “Cluster Viewer” Beta module, which includes a visualization of how the cluster is cabled.

*Capacity Forecasting* – This widget on the cluster dashboard provides a simple view of whether any nodes within the cluster may be running out of capacity. If there are nodes that are over 90% capacity, or may reach that threshold within 6 months, you can select those nodes and reach out to NetApp to request capacity addition.

*Performance* – Available for Internal Users Only – This new widget at the cluster level identifies issues with performance AutoSupport or other performance characteristics at the cluster level. It looks at the following critical areas:

* Truncation issues with Performance AutoSupport
* Nodes within the cluster with over 90% CPU utilization
* Nodes within the cluster with over 50% Disk utilization
* Unbalanced systems

The information icon on the top of the widget provides additional details about these critical attributes and also provides guidance on how you may be able to mitigate these critical conditions.

*Health Summary* – This widget shows the snapshot of risks, best practice gaps, hardware end of support, and alerts of all the nodes within the cluster. You can click any of the numbers within the widget to drill down into the details of each of these components.

*Storage Efficiency* – This widget shows the cluster level efficiency ratio, and also lists the efficiency ratio of individual nodes. To view efficiency details of individual nodes, you can click the arrow on the top right of the widget.

*Software Upgrade Recommendations* – This widget does a gap analysis of different components including ONTAP, drive firmware, system firmware, and shelf firmware. You can download all the details into a worksheet. You can also click on the different components to upgrade the components. ONTAP upgrade recommendation provide the latest and the most modern version of ONTAP that can be upgraded considering the platform checks.

*Cluster Upgrade Advisor* – You can now generate an Upgrade Plan for a cluster from the cluster dashboard page. Click the image:image55.png[image,width=27,height=27] icon to open the screen. All the nodes in a cluster will be upgraded to single ONTAP version. Individual nodes cannot be upgraded to different ONTAP version. Choose between ANDU, NDU, DU or Revert plans and click Generate to generate an upgrade plan.

Newly added functionalities to the upgrade plan:

Upgrade Advisor now performs automated interoperability cluster switch checks for a target ONTAP version.

HCI Expansion Advisor enables you to assess your NetApp HCI systems to determine whether you need to add compute and storage nodes for new and growing workloads.

Expansion Advisor shows the details about the current configuration of your cluster, as well as performance details for compute and storage over the last 30 days. You can specify the growth percentage for an existing workload, or you can enter details about a new workload that you want to add to the system. Expansion Advisor uses this information to recommend whether you need additional compute and storage nodes to accommodate the workload.

When you’re ready to add compute or storage nodes, you can click Request Expansion to send a request for the additional compute and storage nodes. After receiving request, NetApp/Partner contacts you for additional information.
