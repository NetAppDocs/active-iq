The Active IQ 2.0 dashboard displays information about the overall status of your storage system. It analyzes the storage system based on performance & efficiency, availability & protection, capacity, configuration, security, and renewals and provides a score for your storage system.

When you access Active IQ for the first time, by default, the information populated in the dashboard is based on your customer ID. You can then create as many dashboards and add watchlists to these dashboards. Each dashboard will have a score based on the status of the systems added to the dashboard.

You can also view the number and risks for your storage system and the number of actions that need to be taken to mitigate these risks. For example, you many have 100 risks but may need to take only 6 actions to mitigate these 100 risks. Mitigating the risks on time optimizes the performance and efficiency of your storage system.

You should also be aware of the colors applied to the cards, which indicate the severity and type of risks.
