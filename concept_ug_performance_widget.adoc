Performance Widget in customer dashboard displays:

* Systems with Incomplete AutoSupport – Displays information about systems which are sending incomplete AutoSupport due to truncation because of budget limits or SMTP transport protocol
* Systems Over 90% CPU Utilization – Displays information about systems in which CPU utilization is more than 90%. CPU utilization displayed is the hourly averaged maximum utilization in the day based on daily performance AutoSupport data. A performance remediation plan might include setting QoS workload limits, moving volumes or LUNs to another storage controller, or expanding the storage cluster.
* Systems Over 50% Disk Utilization – Displays information about systems in which disk utilization is more than 50%. Disk utilization shown is the hourly averaged maximum utilization in the day based on daily performance AutoSupport data.
* Unbalanced Systems (Delta > 40% CPU) – Displays information about systems in an HA pair where one system is 40% more utilized compared to the partner node. NetApp recommends using no more than 50% CPU on system in order to maintain consistent performance in case of a takeover.
