The dashboard provides an environmental assessment of your storage system and actionable insights for improvement in the form of NetApp's recommended actions.

*Sustainability score*: Displays the total score indicating the environmental sustainability of your storage systems. You can assess the sustainability level of your storage systems based on the following range:

 *  76 - 100: Indicates that sustainability is a top priority.
 *	51 - 75: Indicates a high level of investment in sustainability initiatives.
 *	26 - 50: Indicates good progress towards sustainability initiatives.
 *	Less than 25: Indicates the need for improvement in sustainability practices.

You can see the graphical representation of the score for up to 5 weeks, which is updated on a weekly basis. You can also see the reason for the increase or decrease in the sustainability score by hovering over the graph.

*Environmental indicators*: Displays projections for your power, direct carbon usage, and heat emission to evaluate the environmental health of your storage system. You can view these projections monthly, quarterly, or yearly by selecting the desired timeframe from the drop-down in the top right corner of this section.

*Carbon mitigation percentages*: Displays the percentage of carbon mitigation at each site/city, and the presented baseline values are based on your location. You can adjust the carbon mitigation percentage for specific sites by clicking the image:edit_icon_1.png[A screenshot that shows an editable icon.] icon located next to the percentage values, and the carbon numbers will automatically adjust accordingly.

*Recommended actions*: Displays the list of recommended actions to improve the sustainability score of your storage system. These actions can be taken immediately by selecting the *Fix*. You can expand the view by clicking the *Fix* or the down arrow, and you can see the cluster name, the sustainability score, and subsequent increase if you proceed with the *Fix* option. In the expanded view, you can also see an informative message of proceeding with the *Fix* option.

If you plan to address these actions later, you can move them to the *Actions for later* tab by selecting *Later*. These actions will be postponed for 30 days. After 30 days, these actions will automatically move back to the *Recommended actions* tab. You can also review the postponed actions anytime and can move them back to the *Recommended actions* tab by clicking *Consider*.

*Working environments*: Displays various environmental parameters at the cluster level of your installed base. You can view the sustainability score at cluster level, access *ClusterViewer* by selecting the cluster name, take specific recommended actions from here to improve the sustainability.
 
NOTE: For now, ONTAP systems with AFF, FAS, and CVO are supported.
