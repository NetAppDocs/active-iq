With the *AutoSupport Viewer* you can view full AutoSupport details, including weekly AutoSupport logs. The left panel contains a menu that lists all the subsections of an AutoSupport message. The most commonly used AutoSupport sections appear at the top, and the rest of the sections are listed in alphabetical order. This is a good place to selectively view individual AutoSupport sections without going through the entire AutoSupport message.

By default, wherever available, the sysconfig â€“a section of the latest weekly AutoSupport message is displayed.

You can also download the complete AutoSupport message in either HTML or text format for viewing or troubleshooting.

Newly added functionalities also enable the following:

* Filtering of AutoSupports by type of AutoSupport (Management, Performance, Weekly, Other)
* Searching by section name
* Simple tabular viewing of XML sections - you can change column positions, save column preferences, and download the XML section in an Excel file for further use and analysis.
