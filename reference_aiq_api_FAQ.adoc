== What is an Access Token? Why do I need a Refresh Token?

An access token is a character string, that when added to an API query, authenticates the user and receives a response from Active IQ. The refresh token can be used in a specific API query to obtain a new access token, either before or after the current access token has expired.

== For how long are tokens valid?

The access token expires after 1 hour and the refresh token expires after 7 days. For information on generating new set to tokens, click link:task_ug_api_generating_tokens.html[here].

== How do I know if my token has expired?

API requests will return HTTP Status Code 401 (Unauthorized) and the response body will contain {"message":"Unauthorized"}.
