Before you execute the playbook, ensure that the *NetApp_Ansible_**.*zip* file has been extracted and the web server with disk or shelf firmware files is ready.

== Before you begin

Before executing Ansible Playbook using NetApp docker, you should:

* link:task_update_AFF_FAS_firmware.html[Download the FAS/AFF firmware Ansible Automation package]
* link:task_hosting_firmware_files_using_web_server.html[Host the Firmware files using the web server]
* link:concept_work_with_inventory_file.html[Work with the inventory file]
* Ensure that NetApp Docker is installed.

.Steps
. link:https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Set up Docker]
. Pull the NetApp Docker image from DockerHub by executing the following command:
+
----
$ docker pull schmots1/netapp-ansible

Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from schmots1/netapp-ansible
docker.io/schmots1/netapp-ansible:lates
----
For more information about the docker pull command, refer to the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/[Docker Pull Documentation].

. Run the docker image as a container and log in to the container to execute the playbook.
. Copy the path of the folder which contains the extracted Ansible Playbook and inventory files, for example, *downloaded_playbook_path*. The Ansible Playbook and inventory files should be in the same folder for successful execution.
. Mount the folder as a volume on the Docker container. For example, to mount the folder *container_path*, you should execute the following command:
+
----
$ docker run -v <downloaded_playbook_path>:/<container_path> -it schmots1/netapp-ansible:latest /bin/bash
----
The container starts and the console is now at bash shell of the container. For more information about the docker run command, refer to the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[Docker Run Documentation].

. Execute the playbook inside the container by using the *ansible-playbook* command:
+
----
$ cd <container_path>
$ ansible-playbook na_ontap_pb_upgrade_firmware.yml
