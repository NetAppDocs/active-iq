When you log in to Digital Advisor and notice the red badge on the *Configuration* widget. Upon clicking the widget, you see that the volume is 98% full and this might cause an outage. Fixing this issue would avoid a volume filling up, which would make it go read-only resulting in applications accessing it crash and fail.

.Steps
. Log in to Digital Advisor.
. Click *Actions* in the *Configuration* widget.
