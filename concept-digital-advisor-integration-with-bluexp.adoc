Digital Advisor (formerly Active IQ Digital Advisor) is now fully integrated with BlueXP (formerly Cloud Manager). Users who access the standalone Digital Advisor will be redirected to BlueXP over the coming months.

== Integration overview

Starting in November 2022, a select set of Digital Advisor users will be encouraged to use Digital Advisor from BlueXP. In the months that follow, Digital Advisor users will be redirected from the standalone Digital Advisor (aiq.netapp.com) to the Digital Advisor that's available from BlueXP. Groups of users will be redirected to BlueXP each month, until the standalone Digital Advisor is retired.

Not all Digital Advisor users will be migrated at the same time. Users will be migrated periodically over the coming months. When this happens, you'll see a notification in Digital Advisor that you're being redirected to BlueXP.

From BlueXP, you'll have access to the same Digital Advisor interface that you're used to, plus more. BlueXP enables you to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP), use NetApp's data services (for example, Cloud Backup), and to control many on-prem and edge storage devices. 

The guiding principle for BlueXP is to provide a unified management experience that enables you to manage your storage and data assets from a single interface

== FAQ

Here are answers to questions that you might have about Digital Advisor integration with BlueXP.

=== What is happening?
Active IQ is being renamed to Digital Advisor and is being integrated into , our unified platform for hybrid multicloud environments. 

=== Why is this happening?
A single platform provides stronger capabilities and a one stop solution for all your needs.

With this integration, you can perform all these tasks by yourself easily and quickly. 

Integrating Digital Advisor with BlueXP provides the following benefits:

* Identify and tier cold data to tier to the cloud (or on-prem StorageGRID
* Identify and migrate required workloads that to the cloud 
* Identify and backup systems to the cloud 
* Identify and remediate risks 
* Discover new assets in BlueXP
* Power the digital wallet in BlueXP
* System Manager, CVO management, Upgrade Advisor and CVO upgrades all in one place
* Security risks, ransomware protection, Cloud Data Sense all in one place
* Digital Advisor and Cloud Insights in one place for historical and near real-time monitoring

=== Do I have to move to BlueXP immediately?
No. Two variations of Digital Advisor will exist for now. 
You can continue to use the stand-alone version of Digital Advisor, or you can move to accessing Digital Advisor from BlueXP and enjoy the benefits of the integration.

=== What do I need to do to move to BlueXP?
To access Digital Advisor from BlueXP, you need to first log in to the BlueXP and then look for the Digital Advisor service and log in to Digital Advisor. You will need to log in twice to access Digital Advisor.
