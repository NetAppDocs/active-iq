==== Sample Cable Visualization

You can view the cable visualization to see details of how the cluster is cabled. You can zoom in or out; there are also options to select parts of the visualization. Additionally, you can export the visualization in SVG, which can then be edited in Visio.

==== AutoSupport Alerts

AutoSupport alerts, available from the left navigation pane, are notifications sent to you about issues that may affect the health, availability, or uptime of your storage systems. AutoSupport detects known issues and sends you a notification about them so that you can take mitigation measures. These alerts are available in addition to the e-mail notifications sent out to you. You can also see a history of these alerts for the last 90 days.

You can view AutoSupport alerts at the single-system and aggregate levels. You can also turn off e-mail notifications for these events and apply the preferences at a system or a site level.

The AutoSupport Alerts interface includes AutoSupport header details complete with the contact information of the people receiving the notifications.

==== AutoSupport Alert Subscriptions

On the AutoSupport Alert Subscriptions tab of the AutoSupport Alerts page, enter the email addresses of all the interested parties, and then select the types of AutoSupport alerts for them to receive. In addition to single-system and aggregate-level alerts, subscriptions can also be expanded to site-wide or customer-wide alerts by checking the corresponding “Apply same subscriptions to” box.

For more information about AutoSupport alerts, refer to this Knowledge Base article on the NetApp Support site: https://kb.netapp.com/support/index?page=content&id=7010076

==== Notifications

From the Notifications tab, you can select the AutoSupport notifications that you want to receive.

* Enter all e-mail addresses that should receive the notifications.
* Review all the AutoSupport message types and select the ones that you want to receive.
* Click *Submit* to finalize the changes. All selected AutoSupport notifications are sent to the addresses you specified.

*Best practice*: Use a group distribution list or group e-mail address so that, if individuals are away, others can still receive critical AutoSupport notifications by e-mail.

==== Upgrade Advisor

Upgrade Advisor offers a quick, automated, and accurate way to generate a Data ONTAP upgrade plan. From the System or Customer Dashboard, click the image:image55.png[image,width=27,height=27] icon to open a screen to what is shown in the figure below. By default, if you are clicking this from a system level, all nodes of the cluster or the HA-Pair (for 7-Mode systems) are auto populated.

In the next step, the recommended version of ONTAP is suggested. In some cases, users may prefer to stay at a higher or a lower version of ONTAP based on the needs of their installed base and standards.
