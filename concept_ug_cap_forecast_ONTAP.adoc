=== Capacity Forecasting for ONTAP systems

This widget on the customer dashboard gives you a 1, 3, and 6 months’ view of systems that may have already breached the preset 90% capacity threshold or are about to breach it within these time-periods.

By clicking the icon, you can download details about all the impacted systems. In the following example, the capacity forecast for a customer is:

* Three systems are already over 90% capacity
* There are no systems that will be over 90% capacity in 1 to 6-month timeframe
* There are 171 systems that will be under 90% capacity in 6 months
+
NOTE: Capacity forecasts are computed based on past usage and growth patterns. If there are materially significant changes in usage or growth, then these predictions may not hold and more systems may be over 90% capacity sooner.

To ensure that the systems do not run out of space, you can request for more storage from the Capacity Widget by selecting the systems and clicking the mail icon. You can select multiple systems at once to request capacity.

Total capacity displayed is the sum of all the aggregate’s total capacity and used capacity is the sum of all the aggregate’s physical used space.
