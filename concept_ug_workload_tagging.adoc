Workload Tagging enables users to tag volumes within Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) in ONTAP systems (cluster mode only) with workload details. One or more volumes can be tagged to a specific workload using selecting a workload from the pre-defined dropdown list.

Once volumes are tagged, NetApp will make recommendations and best practices available that will help users to improve performance, efficiency, and availability of NetApp systems.

Workload Tagging can be accessed by clicking the image:image29.png[image,width=21,height=18] icon from left navigation of ONTAP cluster.

In the *Cluster Dashboard*, summary of total number volumes that are not tagged are shown. image:ug_workload.png[untagged workflows,20,18]

You can tag volumes with the Workload, Application, Protocol and Container. Workload is an enterprise workload, and Application is defined as a User Application/Products.

There are three different type of workload tags:

* *ONTAP tag* is the tag obtained from ONTAP AutoSupport when workload template in System Manager is used to provision.
* *Auto Generated Tag* is the tag that is tagged by auto detection mechanisms using machine learning. Active IQ can intelligently identify the type of workload running on the volume. Unidentified volumes are tagged as Other.
* *User Tag* is the tag provided by user manually using tagging feature in workload tagging in Active IQ. Only user tags can be modified or untagged.

Workload Tagging UI is built with rich features including advanced filters. Workload Tag table can be filtered using SVM, Volume Name, Tagged Workloads, Application, Protocol and Container. It helps identifying volumes, workloads and choose multiple volumes to tag at once. You can search for a volume by using a pattern that can match between the volume names. You can also download the entire workload tag list.

==== Workload and Application Efficiency and Capacity

Once the volumes are tagged, Active IQ provides Total Capacity and Efficiency for each workload and application. It also provides volumes level efficiency and capacity. You can filter the workloads in efficiency dashboard based on tag type.

All the efficiency ratios provided are excluding Snapshots and clones.

==== Comparison with Peer Ratio powered by Community Wisdom

Calculated Workload Efficiency Ratio is compared with Peer / Guaranteed Ratio of each workload defined. Peer Ratio is calculated based on average efficiency ratio of the workloads identified using Active IQ community wisdom. Peer Ratio is defined based for each ONTAP version and compared with the respective ONTAP version running on the cluster.

Additional features are planned using Workload Tagging such as showing best practices, performance trends and also tighter integration with other NetApp Products.
