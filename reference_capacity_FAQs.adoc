== How are capacities calculated in Active IQ?
The capacities in Active IQ are calculated for cluster and node—excluding root and including Snapshot copies):
[%autowidth, indent=10]
|===
    |*Capacity*  | *Calculated by adding each aggregate…*

    |Raw Capacity | All Phys (MB/blks) of “SYSCONFIG -R"
    |Usable Capacity | Kbytes (Allocated) of "DF -A"
    |Used Capacity with Reserves |Used of   “DF -A”
    |Available Capacity|Avail of “DF -A”
    |Physical Capacity Actual|Total Physical Used of “AGGR-EFFICIENCY.XML”
    |Logical Capacity Effective|Logical Size Used by Volumes, Clones, and Snapshot copies in the Aggregate of “AGGR-EFFICIENCY.XML”
|===

*For Local tier (Aggregate with Snapshot copies)*
[%autowidth, indent=10]

    |*Capacity*  | *Calculated by using…*

    |Usable Capacity | kbytes (allocated) of "DF -A"
    |Used Capacity with Reserves | Used of   “DF -A”
    |Available Capacity| Avail of “DF -A”
    |Physical Capacity Actual| Total Physical Used of “AGGR-EFFICIENCY.XML”
    |Logical Capacity Effective| Logical Size Used by Volumes, Clones, and Snapshot copies in the Aggregate of “AGGR-EFFICIENCY.XML”
|===

*For Volume (Volume with Snapshot copies)*
[%autowidth, indent=10]
|===

    |*Capacity*  | *Calculated by using…*

    |Volume Capacity | Volume Size of “VOLUME.XML”
    |Used Capacity with Reserves | Used Size of "VOLUME.XML"
    |Available Capacity| Available Size of “VOLUME.XML”
    |Physical Capacity Actual| Total Physical Used of “VOL STATUS -S”
    |Logical Capacity Effective| Logical Used Size of “VOLUME.XML”

== What are Physical Capacity Actual, Logical Capacity Effective, and Used Capacity with Reserve?
*Physical Blocks Consumed/Physical Capacity Actual*
* The amount of space being used for data now (rather than being reserved for future use)
* Includes space used by aggregate Snapshot copies
* Space actually consumed or written by the client

*Logical Capacity Effective/Logical Data Used*
* Displays the logical size used in the aggregate.
* The aggregate incudes Volumes, Clones, and Snapshot copies.
* The logical size is computed based on physical usage (real writes) and savings obtained in the aggregate.
*Note*:	It does not include space reserved for future use.
* Total Data Used/Used Capacity with Reserves
* The sum of all space used or reserved in the aggregate by volumes, metadata, or Snapshot copies.
*Note*:	It includes space reserved for volumes with guarantee volume.

== Why Used Capacity at Node does not match all the volume Used Capacity in the node?
Used Capacity at node includes space reserved by volumes, metadata and Snapshot copies. It also includes space reserved for volumes—file or volume guarantee type. Hence, both might not match.

== Are Capacities shown in Active IQ are Base 2 or Base 10?
All capacities displayed on Active IQ are Base 2 (divide by 1024) and represent capacities in GiB/TiB. The ONTAP storage and other NetApp products also display capacity usage in Base 2.
