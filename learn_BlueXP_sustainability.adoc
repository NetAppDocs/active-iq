Sustainability, as a service, allows you to reduce the energy consumption and enables you to work towards your environmental goals. This enables you to align your storage systems with eco-friendly practices and achieve the sustainability targets.

You can use the Sustainability dashboard to view the sustainability score, and projected usage of power, direct carbon, and heat from the sustainability dashboard. You can adjust the carbon mitigation percentage for specific sites. You can also view the sustainability score at the cluster level. Based on the sustainability score, you can assess the sustainability posture and implement NetAppâ€™s recommended actions to improve the score.
