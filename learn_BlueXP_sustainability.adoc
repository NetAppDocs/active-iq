You can use the BlueXP sustainability dashboard to achieve your environmental goals. You can view the sustainability score, and projected usage of power, direct carbon, and heat from the sustainability dashboard. You can adjust the carbon mitigation percentage for specific sites. You can also view the sustainability score at the cluster level.
