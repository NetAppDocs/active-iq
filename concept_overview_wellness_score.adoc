Wellness score provides detailed information about your storage system. It provides information about different attributes of your storage system, such as performance and efficiency, capacity, configuration settings, security, renewals, and others.

It lists the risks associated with each of these attributes, and also provides information to mitigate these risks, thereby improving the overall condition of the storage system.
