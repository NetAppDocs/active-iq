Wellness score provides detailed information about your storage system. It provides information about different attributes of your storage system, such as performance and efficiency, capacity, configuration settings, security, and others. Wellness score proactively provides information about software and hardware that have expired or are near expiration in the next 6 months.

It lists the risks associated with each of these attributes, and also provides information to mitigate these risks, thereby improving the overall condition of the storage system.

You can also view the peer comparison percentile to view your position when compared to your peers. Mitigating all these risks and proactively taking actions to keep your system up to date increases your peer comparison percentile.
