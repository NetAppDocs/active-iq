You should add a template to compare the system and cluster configurations and detect the configuration deviations in near real time. The config drift templates are added using systems running AutoSupport data.

*About this task*

The attributes in a config drift template are editable, and the following groups of the template support regular expressions for some sections:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| Group
| Section
| Attribute
| *AGGREGATE*
| AGGR-INFO.XML
| Name
| *CLUSTER*
| CLUSTER-INFO.XML
| cluster-name
| *LUN*
| LUN.XML
| Name
| *VSERVER*
| VSERVER-INFO.XML
| Vserver
| *NETWORK*
| NETWORK-INTERFACE.XML
| vif
| *DNS*
| DNS.XML
| domains
| *VOLUME*
| VOLUME.XML
| vol
|===

Using a regular expression, a user can create a config drift report that includes drifts arising from naming inconsistencies of volumes, aggregates, clusters, and so on. For instance, if a regular expression *aggr-name** is mentioned for the attribute *Name* for the section *AGGR-INFO.XML* in the group *AGGREGATE*, then the values of the attribute without the prefix *aggr-name* are marked as a drift when the config drift report is generated.
