=== BlueXP is now NetApp Console

BlueXP has been renamed and redesigned to better reflect the role it has in managing your data infrastructure.

The NetApp Console provides centralized management of storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise grade—delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration.
