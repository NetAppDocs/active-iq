BlueXP sustainability dashboard generates recommended actions that you can use to improve the sustainability score. You can view and implement these recommended actions from NetApp BlueXP or Digital Advisor.

You can improve the overall sustainability score that focuses on sustainability efforts at company level. You can also improve the cluster-level sustainability score that focuses on improving sustainability for a specific cluster.

NOTE: AutoSupport must be enabled to calculate the cluster-level sustainability score.
