Storage dashboard shows the storage efficiency ratio, capacity and savings for entire storage systems running ONTAP 9.1 and above. Efficiency ratio and savings can be seen with and without Snapshots, and for only AFF, only non-AFF systems, or both.

Total savings across customer storage can be seen per efficiency feature such as snapshots, clones, deduplication, compression and compaction.
