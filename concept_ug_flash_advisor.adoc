Flash Advisor recommends a list of volumes that contain workloads that will perform better if moved to AFF systems. Users can select volumes and submit a request to upgrade the system to flash.

The list of volumes is determined by looking at characteristicâ€™s other users across the installed base have benefited from. A list of these characteristics is available from the information icon on the top right of this widget.
