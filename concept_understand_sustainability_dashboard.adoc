Sustainability, as a service, allows you to reduce the energy consumption and enables you to work towards the environmental goals. With the help of the Sustainability dashboard, you can get insights into the environmental sustainability of your storage systems. This enables you to align your storage systems with eco-friendly practices and achieve the sustainability goals. 

== What can you do with the sustainability service

You can view the sustainability score, and projected usage of power, direct carbon, and heat. You can adjust the carbon mitigation percentage for specific sites. Based on the sustainability score, you can assess the overall efficiency of your storage system and align with the NetApp recommended best practices to improve the score. 

You can also view the sustainability score at the cluster level. The data provided at the cluster level can also help to identify workloads that can be moved to more efficient storage, achieving the right balance between performance and power efficiency.
