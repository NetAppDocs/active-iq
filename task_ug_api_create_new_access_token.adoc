An access token expires after one hour and a refresh token expires after seven days. Calling an API with an expired access token will result in a HTTP status code of 401 (Unauthorized) error. You can use a valid refresh token to generate a new access token and a refresh token. The old refresh token is invalidated after the new refresh token is generated.

1. Navigate to *List of API Services → Token Generation → Token Manager → accessToken API* to view the API for programmatically generating new access token and refresh token.
