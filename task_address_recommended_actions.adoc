You can implement the recommended actions to improve your overall sustainability posture, ranging from compaction to deduplication, from compression to caching and tiering, and more.

.Steps
. Go to *Sustainability* from the *Governance* category available in the BlueXP left navigation, or from the *STORAGE HEALTH* category available in the left navigation of Digital Advisor dashboard.
. Go to the *Recommended actions* tab. 
  * These actions can be taken immediately by selecting *Fix*, or address later by selecting *Later*.
  * Select *Fix* if you plan to address the actions immediately.
  ** It expands the view of the selected recommended action. You can also expand the recommended action view by using the down arrow. In the expanded view, you can see the cluster name, the sustainability score, and subsequent increase if you proceed with the *Fix* option. You can also see an informative message of proceeding with the *Fix* option.
